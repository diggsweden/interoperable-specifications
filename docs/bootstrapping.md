# Bootstrapping specifications

To make interoperable specifications work we need a clear way to identify the different parts. This is achieved by indicating the character of various resources by saying that they conform to a specification. Note that these bootstrapping specifications need not be interoperable specifications in themselves (but it does not hurt if they are).

The bootstrapping specifications have not yet received a stable namespace, but a good candidate may be:

namespace | expansion
--- | ---
inspec | http://purl.org/inspec/

## inspec:PROF

This is a specification corresponding to a profile of PROF used to capture an interoperable specification. Corresponds to the rules INSPEC-1 — INSPEC-8.

## inspec:RDFS

This is a specification corresponding to a profile of RDFS used to capture an expression of data vocabularies. Corresponds to the rules DV-1 — DV-6.

## inspec:SKOS

This is a specification corresponding to a profile of SKOS used to capture an expression of terminologies. Corresponds to the rules TE-1 — TE-5.

## inspec:SHACL

This is a specification corresponding to a profile of SHACL used to capture an expression of application profiles. Corresponds to the rules AP-1 — AP-10.

## inspec:SVG

This is a specification corresponding to a profile of SVG used to capture an expression of diagrams for interoperable specifications. Corresponds to the rules SVG-1 — SVG-5.
